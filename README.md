Exploratory data analysis on netflix dataset 
<br>
<h1><project overview<h1/>
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about the content available on the platform.
The dataset includes details such as titles, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and listed genres.

Through this analysis, we aim to understand content trends, patterns, and distributions that can help answer questions such as:

What type of content (Movies vs TV Shows) dominates Netflix?

Which countries produce the most Netflix content?

How have content releases evolved over the years?

What are the most common genres and ratings?
